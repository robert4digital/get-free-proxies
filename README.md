# Get free proxies in Python
Get the list of free proxies using https://free-proxy-list.net

There are two type of script to obtain a list of proxy IP:port number from the free-proxy-list.net:
- using [*urllib*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html) or 
- using [*BeautifulSoup*](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/).

Urllib will provide you 164 proxies but BeautifulSoup will give you the entire list of 300 proxies.

Enjoy programming!
